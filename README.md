# QM9 Analysis
A sample code for analysis and modeling of QM9 dataset, including preprocessing adjustment based on [qml](https://github.com/qmlcode/qml) and machine learning models. 

+ Modeling molecular representation: Columb Matrix (CM), Bags of Bonds (BOB)
+ Machine learning: Kernel Ridge Regression, Random Forest. 

### Dataset

[QM9](https://figshare.com/collections/Quantum_chemistry_structures_and_properties_of_134_kilo_molecules/978904) includes the spatial information and 12 quantum properties of 13385 small molecules for quantum chemistry research. 

### Usage

+ Download [QM9 dataset](https://figshare.com/collections/Quantum_chemistry_structures_and_properties_of_134_kilo_molecules/978904)

+ Install [QML](https://github.com/qmlcode/qml) (Quantum machine learning) toolkit. Note that QML is built for analysis of QM7 (another dataset). 

+ Adjust the data preprocessing process in QML. Replace the *compound.py* file in src of QML.

  ```bash
  mv qml/qml/compound.py compound_qm7.py
  cp compound.py qml/qml/compound.py
  ```

+ Input the parameters in main.py. Choose Representation, Data size, Hyperparameter.

+ Run *python main.py* to perform validating and testing.
